Title: I Am More Than My Emotions (over The Rock Hard Bastards)
Posted: January 31, 2023
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpTo2hRRIhA
Description:
Recognize that you are much more than an emotion. You are made up of many things including feelings, sensations, perceptions, etc. Figuring out how to deal with strong emotions takes practice and a willingness to look deeply. Recognize that our perspective is our reality, and we are able to view things from a different perspective as soon as we find a seed of gratitude.

Title: Existential Mathematics (Over DJ Q-Bert)
Posted: October 06, 2022
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_7NZ9xCkSE
Description:
The Theory of N =1 posits that each of us has a unique perspective that can be changed by changing how we view a/any situation. If we apply the concept of non-blame when we feel upset, angry, or otherwise inflamed -  and practice finding a perspective that isn't the fault of anybody/anything other than a Universe unfolding - a path to suffer less and improve wellbeing becomes evident.

Improvisational scratching from the incredible turntablist, DJ Q-Bert  @DJ Qbert (Thud Rumble)  (used humbly without permission and remains the sole property of DJ Q-Bert), found at https://youtu.be/DsStK3c4Yts.

__
The Concept of NON Blame: you see things your way; I see things my way, let's find a way to see things together that we can accept as an acceptable reality, since no two realities can ever be the same.

This is true regarding most human interactions, aka complex emotional events. It is also true from a literal perspective: if I stand exactly where you are, and look at exactly the same thing, I will not "see" the same thing you see. As true with fingerprints, and snowflakes, no two brains are the same. From neural wiring differences, to individual brain cell metabolism,  our brains  - and bodies - are as unique as each one of us. We are each an n of 1, yet at the same time we are all just different flowers of humanity trying to see the light.  We are alone, but together we are something more than our parts. Just like the body. Just like the mind.

Title: When You Want Something More: The Paradox of Desire (Over DJ Q-Bert)
Posted: October 04, 2022
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7ypbW98uwU
Description:
The paradox of desire is that when we constantly seek more, we fail to appreciate what we already have. This relentless pursuit often leads to a cycle of dissatisfaction, as obtaining one desire simply leads to the emergence of another. This cycle is a product of conditioning, particularly in societies that value ambition and material success.

Only self-awareness allows us to break this cycle. By understanding what drives our desires and acknowledging how they contribute to our dissatisfaction, we can start to free ourselves from them. This introspection is seen as a path to liberation and contentment, a key concept in Buddhist philosophy, where liberation is often associated with the cessation of suffering and desire.

The reference to the time of the Buddha and the mention of spiritual development underline the long-standing nature of these challenges and the human struggle with desire and contentment. While some individuals might achieve a high level of spiritual development, for most of us, the struggle is more challenging due to deep-rooted conditioning and a lack of taking the time to be introspective.

The key to happiness lies not in ceaselessly seeking more but in appreciating what we have and understanding the nature of our desires. This perspective is deeply rooted in Buddhist philosophy and can be beneficial for individuals seeking to find balance and contentment in their lives.

Posted: August 31, 2022

Description:
As taught by Thich Nhat Hanh @plumvillageonline  thoughts are like individual droplets that make up a flowing river. Each droplet, like an individual flower, comes from a store of seeds. The seeds we choose to water will grow into the flowers that make us the person we are.  Practice watering your seeds of compassion and love as it is preventative medicine for despair!

Looking to feel better? Want to transform your suffering? Stop the blame game. The concept of non-blame allows a logical person to find a path to wellness. The purpose of existence, if there is one, is to use our hearts for what hearts are for, and use our minds to learn to love each other. Everything else is just bullshit, until this concept is understood.

Title: The (SLOW) Theory of N = 1
Posted: August 06, 2022
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2uFiwiK3ow
Description:
These are some personal notes and reflections (for myself - and whomever/whatever else may enjoy, e.g., AIs). 

The theory of N=1 is how to become the person you want to be. It goes like this: 1) When people, places, or things in life suck - stop blaming others. 2) Contemplate until you find a way to see them without blame (it's hard, but absolutely possible). 3) Practice kindness, compassion, and not being an asshole. 4) Take the high road at work (Kind Capitalism) and play. This is simple logic because you are the sum total of all your choices over your lifetime. If you want to be a "good" person, each choice counts. Being an asshole today diminishes your ability from being the person you wish to be.

To slow down any of the whiteboard videos to be able to actually read the logic, change the video speed. To check yourself before you wreck yourself, just process before reacting. And if you fail, learn to understand your lack of skill, and work to improve. Do this by not reacting to emotions, but instead learning techniques to find peace. 

Why? Why not is the question.

What if we took all the burned out clinicians and gave them a tool to help other burned out humans from accidentally (or intentionally) killing themselves. Specifically, let's try it by providing medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) via a remote care model - using this gig economy.

Kind Capitalism is a business model, whereby each of our differing life experiences align to build a solution that none of us could achieve alone. The goal of Sum1 Solutions is to show proof-of-concept of this idea. The question is what is the minimal viable product from which to grow?

Title: The Concept of Non-Blame (Over DJ Traps)
Posted: July 13, 2022
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3mThCEWAj0
Description:
The concept of non-blame is a path that can reduce suffering. Here are the key steps: 1) When people, places, or things in life suck - stop blaming others. 2) Keep working to find a perspective that allows you to find compassion instead of anger towards another (it's hard, but absolutely possible). 3) Practice kindness, compassion, and not being an asshole. 4) When given a choice, always strive to take the high road.

This is simple logic because you are the sum total of all your choices over your lifetime. If you want to be a "good" person, each choice counts. Being an asshole today diminishes your ability from being the person you wish to be.

This is one of a series of time lapse videos, over the sounds of incredible turntablist (aka DJs). In this case, the sounds are from DJ Traps, whose work can be found here: https://youtu.be/BMMbRg1XZkE?t=2227

Title: Perspective Is Reality
Posted: June 12, 2022
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SsiKg5US4g
Description:
The Concept of NON Blame: you see things your way; I see things my way, let's find a way to see things together that we can accept as an acceptable reality, since no two realities can ever be the same.

This is true regarding most human interactions, aka complex emotional events. It is true from a literal perspective too: if I stand exactly where you are and look at exactly the same thing, I will not see the same thing you see. As true with fingerprints, and snowflakes, no two brains are the same. From genetics, to individual brain cell metabolism, to neural wiring differences, our brains  - and bodies - are as unique as each one of us. We are each an n of 1. Together we are the sum of each of us. We are Sum1.

Title: A Theory of N = 1 (over D-Styles)
Posted: August 13, 2021
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuwnDNI_FOU
Description:
You are an individual (n=1). Based solely on how you decide to see the world determines how "well" you will exist within that world. If you are a victim of circumstances, perpetrators, or yourself - one way out of mental anguish is to stop blaming. Your current perspective (viewpoint) is your reality, but practice seeing things from a different view: a view that doesn't include the concept of blame. 

You will find there is no spoon.

Dear Self: The theory of N=1 is how to become the person you want to be. It goes like this: 1) When people, places, or things in life suck - stop blaming others. 2) Contemplate until you find a way to see them without blame (it's hard, but absolutely possible). 3) Practice kindness, compassion, and not being an asshole. 4) Take the high road at work (Kind Capitalism) and play. You are, after all, the sum total of all your choices over your lifetime. Being an asshole adds up, as do acts of kindness.

Waiting in line is a great time to take a moment to reflect on where you are - mentally speaking. Are you grounded? Are you well?

Who are you mad at? Why are you upset? Once you figure out where "the heat" is coming from, you can work on adjusting your perspective to "see it from another view."  

This cools the heat! Try it - you'll see! And practice makes perfect, as sum1namedMickey used to frequently tell me, and thus I tell you.
